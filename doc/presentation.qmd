## Materials and methods {background-image=background.png}

### Data preparation 
- We converted the raw file into a **tidy dataset**:
  - one row = one patient
  - one column = one variable
  - each variable has a consistent data type
  
### PCA 
- didn't work 

### Survival analysis 

## Results and Discussion {background-image=background.png}

put : 
- correlation plot (lower number so every variables are independants = that's why we can't do a PCA), PCA and we explain why PCA doesn't work for our dataset 
- survival curve
- AP curve from the survival analysis 

to put image : ![](plot name){fig-align=center}

## Conclusion
